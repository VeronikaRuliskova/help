## How can I register Text Sender ID?
You can choose from different [sender types](sender-type.md#what-is-a-sender-type-and-how-can-i-use-it) when sending your [SMS notifications](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/solutions/sms/#sms-notification) (transactional SMS) and [bulk SMS](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/solutions/sms/#bulk-sms) (promotional SMS) messages. 

### DYNAMIC Text Sender ID
You can change text sender ID directly in the [module](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-module/) or in the [Portal.](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-portal/) Either in the second step of [SMS campaign](creating-sms-campaign.html#how-do-i-create-sms-campaign) or when you send individual SMS from your dashboard. 

In the SMS campaign:
1.	Reach the second step of the campaign – Message
2.	Select Text Sender ID in the right-upper corner
3.	Enter name of the Text Sender ID

### Registration of Text Sender ID
In some countries, some mobile carriers require registration of Text Sender ID (see the [price list;](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-price/) red * symbol), and you therefore can’t use dynamic Text Sender ID unless you register it. 

To register your own Text Sender ID:
1.	Contact us via [contact form](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/contact-us/)
2.	Select recipient: Text Sender ID registration
3.	In the text, include the country for which you want to register the Text Sender ID
