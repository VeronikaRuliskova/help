## What are credits and do they have an expiration date?
Credits are a virtual currency at [BulkGate Portal.](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-portal/) If you want to create SMS campaign for example, you must have a sufficient balance of credits on your account first. See [how to buy credits.](#how-can-i-buy-credits) Also, before you buy credits, check the [price list](using-price-list.md#how-to-use-price-list) and calculate your next campaign cost. 

**`Please note that credits don’t have any expiration date. They disappear only when you spend them.`**
