## What are credits? Do they expire?
Credits are a virtual currency in BulkGate [SMS Portal,](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-portal/) [SMS modules](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-module/) and [SMS APIs.](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/developers/sms-api/) If you want to create SMS campaign for example, you must have a sufficient balance of credits on your account first. See [how to buy credits.](#how-can-i-buy-credits) Also, before you buy credits, check the [SMS price list](using-price-list.md#how-to-use-price-list) and calculate your next campaign cost. 

**`Please note that credits donâ€™t have any expiration date. They disappear only when you spend them.`**
