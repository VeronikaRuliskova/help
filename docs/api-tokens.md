## What is an API token?
API token **`(APPLICATION_TOKEN)`** serves as a security measure for your API. It is a key that you need to access your API. You should never provide it to anyone. 

However, if you are in doubts and think someone may have an access to your API, you should [disable the token](https://github.com/BulkGate/help/blob/master/docs/api-administration.md#how-can-i-disable-my-api-token) or [add a new token.](#how-can-i-add-a-new-token) 

## How can I disable my API token?
To disable your API token:
1.	Log in to [BulkGate Portal](https://portal.bulkgate.com)
2.	Go to Modules & APIs
3.	Select for which API you want to disable the token and click on it
4.	Click on Token actions (3 vertical dots) and click disable

You might want to [add a new token.](#how-can-i-add-a-new-token)

## How can I add a new token?
To add a new token for your API:
1.	Log in to [BulkGate Portal](https://portal.bulkgate.com)
2.	Go to Modules & APIs
